# Securing API Access for `api.vinylvibe.live`

Below outlines the steps to:

1. Redirect users accessing `api.vinylvibe.live` directly in a browser to the frontend (`vinylvibe.live`).
2. Ensure API responses are accessible only from the frontend (`vinylvibe.live`).
3. Block or redirect requests from unauthorized origins.

## Frontend Code (No Changes Needed)

-   The frontend will continue to send requests to the API at `https://api.vinylvibe.live`.
-   No modifications are required in your frontend.

---

## Backend Code (Node.js/Express)

1. **Redirect Root Endpoint**
    - Redirect any request to `https://api.vinylvibe.live/` (without an API path) to your frontend.
    - Add this code to your `index.js` or main backend file:
        ```javascript
        app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        	res.redirect("https://vinylvibe.live");
        });
        ```

---

2. **CORS Configuration**

    - Only allow requests from your frontend (`https://vinylvibe.live`) or API subdomain (`https://api.vinylvibe.live`).
    - Add this code to configure CORS:

        ```javascript
        const cors = require("cors");

        const allowedOrigins = [
        	"https://vinylvibe.live",
        	"https://api.vinylvibe.live",
        ];

        app.use(
        	cors({
        		origin: function (origin, callback) {
        			if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        				callback(null, true);
        			} else {
        				callback(new Error("Not allowed by CORS"));
        			}
        		},
        	})
        );
        ```

---

3. **Middleware to Check Origin**

    - Add middleware to validate the `Origin` or `Referer` headers for requests that bypass CORS (e.g., via tools like Postman).
    - If the request does not come from an allowed origin, redirect it to your frontend or block it.

    ```javascript
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
    	const allowedOrigins = [
    		"https://vinylvibe.live",
    		"https://api.vinylvibe.live",
    	];
    	const origin = req.get("origin");

    	if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    		return next();
    	}

    	// Redirect to frontend if the origin is invalid
    	res.redirect("https://vinylvibe.live");
    });
    ```

---

4. **Block Unauthorized Requests**

    - For additional security, return a `403 Forbidden` status for requests that donâ€™t meet the origin criteria:

        ```javascript
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
        	const allowedOrigins = [
        		"https://vinylvibe.live",
        		"https://api.vinylvibe.live",
        	];
        	const origin = req.get("origin");

        	if (!origin || allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        		next();
        	} else {
        		res.status(403).json({ error: "Forbidden" });
        	}
        });
        ```

---

## Testing

1. Visit `https://api.vinylvibe.live` in a browser:
    - You should be redirected to `https://vinylvibe.live`.
2. Make requests to the API from the frontend (`vinylvibe.live`):
    - Requests should work without errors.
3. Test requests from unauthorized origins (e.g., Postman):
    - Requests should fail with `403 Forbidden` or be redirected.

---

By following these steps, your API will only respond to requests made by your frontend, and direct or unauthorised access will be blocked.
